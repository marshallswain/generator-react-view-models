feathers-reactvm-boilerplate

This is a starter client app that uses the following:

 - [Feathers client](https://docs.feathersjs.com/clients/feathers.html): connectivity
 - [feathers-reactive](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-reactive): RxJS observable services
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): view layer with custom components
 - [@BigAB/react-view-models](https://github.com/BigAB/react-view-models): Mobx-like state management modeled after Redux
 - [can-connect-feathers](https://github.com/feathersjs/canjs-feathers): connect model-layer state to `feathers-client`
 - [can-route](https://github.com/canjs/can-route): advanced, state-based routing
 - [StealJS](http://stealjs.com/): package management with hot module swap
 - [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard): linting tool based on JsLint (similar to [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard), but with semicolons)
